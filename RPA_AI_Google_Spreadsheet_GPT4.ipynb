            "    Uneven Legs: The table wobbles like a beginner attempting a complex dance move, thanks to uneven leg lengths. This poses a safety risk to both customers and employees, creating an unwelcome tension in the shopping environment.\r\n",

            "    Size: Approximately 4ft x 3ft to maintain current floor space, ensuring a smooth flow within the aisle.\r\n",
            "    Material: A durable surface resistant to scratches and dents, reflecting the quality and strength of our brand (e.g., metal, laminate).\r\n",
            "    Stability: Level legs and sturdy construction to prevent wobbling, creating a safe and secure environment for everyone.\r\n",

            "I understand this is an urgent request, and I am committed to collaborating to find a solution that fits within our budget's melody. Please let me know what information you require to proceed. I am available to discuss further details and specifications at your convenience.\r\n",
